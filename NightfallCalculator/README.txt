About this website:

For my midterm sprint I decided to tackle something that I've been actively thinking about. 
I play a competitive online videogame called Dead by Daylight where 4 "survivor" players team 
up against one "killer" player, the survivors' goal is to repair generaters to 
power the exit gates to escape, and the killer's goal is to stop the survivors 
and kill them.

I've been playing as this one killer called The Dredge who has a power that revolves
around slowly building up "charges" to power his ultimate ability called "Nightfall".

Long story short, the ways that different actions power up Nightfall is really confusing
to me and most players online, because the math behind it is somewhat complex.

Additionally, there are certain "add-ons" you can equip in the game that provide perks to modify how
quickly you can build up Nightfall charges through various means, and this adds to the complexity.

It is very unclear and confusing which add-ons have a greater effect, and in what 
circumstances. It is also unclear which player actions are more efficient for charging
nightfall compared to others.

As such, I decided to make a very comprehensive website about The Dredge's power, 
the main feature of which is a "Nightfall Calculator" which takes in player 
match stats and displays how quickly those stats generate Nightfall. 

This website could help competitive and even eSports players test out various gameplay
circumstances and how it could affect your efficiency in attaining Nightfall.

Accompanying the Calculator is two pages, one which describes the numbers behind Nightfall
and the other explains The Dredge's power in detail for newer players.
